# 🎂 Birthrack

**Birthrack** is a Python tool that generates password lists by combining a username with all possible birth dates (`0101`–`1231`).  
It supports symbols like `_` or `@` before the birthday, and handles username variations (lowercase, capitalized, uppercase).  
Useful for security testing and password auditing.  
Outputs results to a `.txt` file.
